### Task:

1) Form three groups from a normally distributed population, each consisting of 30 to 50 observations, with equal variances and different means.
2) Find the overall and individual means.
3) Plot a graph.
4) Find the total variance, average within-group variance, and between-group variance.
5) Test the rule of addition of variances.
6) Find the correlation ratio.
7) Find the coefficient of determination.
8) Use Chaddock's scale to assess the strength of the influence of the grouping factor.
