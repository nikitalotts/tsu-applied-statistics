### Task 1: Group Comparisons for Modeled Data

A) Generate two samples from normally distributed populations, $X1 \sim N(a1, σ1)$ and $X2 \sim N(a2, σ2)$ (each with a sample size between 50 and 100), satisfying four situations.

1. Equal variances. No statistically significant differences between means.
2. Equal variances. Statistically significant differences between means.
3. Unequal variances. No statistically significant differences between means.
4. Unequal variances. Statistically significant differences between means.

B) For each situation:

1. Test hypotheses regarding normality, equality of variances, and equality of means.
2. Plot histograms for $X1$ and $X2$, estimate densities for both samples, and mark the mean values with vertical lines on the same graph.
3. Plot box plots on another graph.


### Task 2: Correlation Analysis for Modeled Data

1. Generate two samples of observations from Gaussian populations of variables $X$ and $Y$ with their respective parameters and a specified correlation coefficient $r_{xy}$.
2. Find the estimate of the correlation coefficient.
3. Test the hypothesis of the significance of the correlation relationship.
4. Visualize the relationship using a scatter plot.

### Task 3: Group Comparison and Correlation Analysis for Real Data

1. Import data from datasets on apartment rental prices.
2. Determine the types of variables included in the dataset.
3. Plot histograms for numeric data.
4. Test hypotheses regarding the normality of distributions where applicable.
5. For analyzing the relationship between numeric and categorical features, construct boxplots and apply group comparison tests.
6. Remove outliers obtained when dividing rental prices by city districts.
7. Calculate correlation coefficients and test their significance for analyzing the relationship between quantitative and ordinal variables.
8. Construct contingency tables and perform analysis for examining the relationship between categorical features.
