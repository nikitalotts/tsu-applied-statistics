### Task 1. Simple Linear Regression Model.

1. Build a simple regression model of rent based on the area using the Rent dataset.
2. Assess the quality of the model and perform residual analysis.
3. Make predictions for "your" area value.

### Task 2. Multiple Linear Regression Model. Dummy Variables. Multicollinearity.

1. Construct a multiple linear regression model of rent using all available factors in the Rent dataset.
2. Evaluate the quality of the model and perform residual analysis.
3. Interpret the obtained results.
4. Make predictions for "your" apartment with given feature values.

### Task 3. Multiple Linear Regression Model. Dummy Variables. Heteroscedasticity
1. Build a simple regression model of price based on area using the "flats.txt" dataset.
2. Evaluate the quality of the simple regression model.
3. Construct a multiple linear regression model using all available factors.
4. Assess the quality of the multiple regression model.
5. Perform residual analysis for the constructed models.
6. Test for heteroscedasticity of the residuals using the Goldfeld-Quandt test.
7. Address heteroscedasticity.
8. Conduct residual analysis for the new model.

###  Task 4. Nonlinear Multiple Regression Model. Dummy Variables. Multicollinearity.
1. Select the most appropriate multiple regression model for a dataset on fuel consumption.
2. Evaluate the quality of the model.
